## Dennis Vineyards
We cannot say enough amazing things about our wedding venue, [Dennis Vineyards](https://www.dennisvineyards.com/)!

This family owned venue has amazing staff, a beautiful vineyard, top notch facilities, and great wine!

Nestled in their own quaint little corner of North Carolina wine country, Dennis Vineyards is located in the small little town of Albemarle, just a short 40 minute drive from Charlotte. Boasting eleven acres of pristine muscadine vineyards and gently rolling hills, it truly is a sight to see.
